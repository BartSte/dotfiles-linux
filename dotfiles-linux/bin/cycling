"""
Script to estimate the minimal number of calories burned while cycling. The
assumptions are chosen convervatively, meaning that the actual number of
calories burned is likely greater than the estimate.

Assumptions:
    - Wind speed is 0 m/s
    - No drafting behind other cyclists.
    - A constant speed is maintained throughout the ride.

A rough check to demonstrate the validity is by comparing it to the following
site:

    - https://www.gribble.org/cycling/power_v_speed.html?units=metric&rp_wr=70&rp_wb=10&rp_a=0.62&rp_cd=0.63&rp_dtl=2&ep_crr=0.003&ep_rho=1.293&ep_g=0&ep_headwind=0&p2v=200&v2p=30

where the same parameters are used as in this script. For a 80 kg cyclist + bike
that cycles 30 km in 1 hour, you get:

    If you want to ride at groundspeed velocity 30 km/h, you must apply 169.13
    watts of power.

So, in 1 hour, with an efficiency of 0.25, the energy consumption per hour is:

    (169.13 W * 3600 s) / 0.25 = 2435472 J = 2435 kJ

where 2435 kJ is equal to 581 kcal.


If we run the following command:

    cal-cycling 80 30 01:00

results in:

    Average power:                169 W
    Energy consumption cyclist:   581 kcal

Which is close enough.

        3 forces are considered that the cyclist has to overcome:
            - Rolling resistance, created by the tires on the road.
            - Drag, created by the air resistance.
            - Gravity, created by the slope of the road.

        Using these forces, and the traveled distance, the work that needs to be
        done in joules is calculated.

        In reality, the cyclist and the drive train are not 100% efficient.
        Hence, the work done by the human will be greater than the energy that
        is actually supplied to the pedals. This is taken into account by the
        `efficiency_human` and the `efficiency_drive_train` parameters.

        In the case of a cyclist, the efficiency is typically around 0.25. Thus,
        the work supplied by the cyclist must be divided by the efficiency to
        get the actual energy needed by the cyclist.

        In the case of the drive train, the efficiency is typically around 0.95.
        This means that 5% of the energy supplied by the cyclist to the pedals
        is lost in the drive train.

        The human and drive train efficiency are combined in the `efficiency`
