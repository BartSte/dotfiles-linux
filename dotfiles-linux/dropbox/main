After installing dropbox, you need to authenticate it with your account. At the
moment of writing, the only way was to do this through a tray icon. Waybar did 
not work from me so I did the following:
- Run xwayland
- Intall the program `trayer`
- Run trayer.
- Run dropbox.
- Dropbox will apear in the tray icon.
- Press `sign in` and follow the instructions.

# On wsl dropbox on windows is used instead
running_wsl || systemctl --user enable dropbox && systemctl --user start dropbox
